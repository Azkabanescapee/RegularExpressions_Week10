## What are Regular Expressions?
    - Editing text files is one of the most common tasks in computational biology
    - Often these files contain datasets whose format needs to be changed or from which some information needs to be extracted
    - Accomplishing these tasks by hand is tedious at best, and impossible in many cases
    - Regular expressions are an advanced form of find-and-replace that can be used to manipulate complex patterns of text
    - Regular expressions are often abbreviated as `regex`
    - Regular expression syntax can be used in a variety of different programs and contexts, including Atom, `grep`, and `sed`.

## What are Regular Expressions (regex)?
    
- Editing and searching through text files is one of the most common tasks in computational biology.
- Often these files contain datasets whose format needs to be changed or from which some information needs to be extracted.
- Accomplishing these tasks by hand is tedious at best, and impossible in many cases.
- Regular expressions are an advanced form of find-and-replace that can be used to manipulate complex patterns of text.
- Regular expressions are often abbreviated as `regex`.
- Regular expression syntax can be used in a variety of different programs and contexts, including Python, Sublime, `grep`, and `sed`.

## Importing and Using the `re` Module

The `re` module gives us the ability to use regular expression syntax in Python code. To use this functionality, we'll need to start by importing it

`import re`

While there is a lot that we can do using `re`, we'll start by focusing on two very useful tasks: searching for patterns of text and doing find-and-replace.

After importing `re`, you can search for a particular pattern of text in a string using `re.search(r<pattern>,<string>)`

`re.search(r"ttt","aggtttcctttagttt")`

The letter `r` that appears before the search pattern tells Python that you're searching for raw text. You'll pretty much always want to use it, so just get in the habit of having it there. If the pattern is found, the `search` function will return an `re.Match` object. If the pattern is not found, it will return the value `None`.  You can use this to execute an `if...else` statement

```
if re.search(r"ttt","aggtttcctttagttt"):
    print("Pattern found!")
else:
    print("Pattern not found!")
```

The other function from `re` that we'll need to use a lot is `re.sub()`. This substitution function allows us to conduct find-and-replace. The general syntax is `re.sub(<findPattern>,<replacePattern>,<string>)`.

`re.sub("ttt","TTT","aggtttcctttagttt")`

## Simple Pattern Matching

The simplest types of patterns that you can work with using regular expressions are literal strings of characters, as in typical find-and-replace operations you've probably done in a text editor or word processing program. The example we've already used of a precise pattern of nucleotides in a DNA sequence uses the literal string "ttt" as a search pattern.

`re.search(r"ttt","aggtttcctttagttt")`

Literal patterns are very useful in many contexts, but the real power of regex comes from its flexibility. For instance, let's say that we wanted to search for any part of the sequence where there is a g, then any 3 nucleotides, then a c. In this case, we don't care what the intervening 3 nucleotides are, so we can use a wildcard character that could match any of them. The simplest regex wildcard is `.`, which matches any character other than a newline. Now, our search is

`match = re.search(r"g...c","aggtttcctttagttt")`

If we store the output of our regex search in a variable (in this case, called `match`), we can take a look at the actual sequence that matched our pattern by using the `.group()` method of the object that was returned from our search.

`match.group()`

In this case, our search found the pattern "gtttc". However, take a look at the same search, but with a different sequence this time

```
match = re.search(r"g...c","attcgaagcaggtttcct")
match.group()
```
